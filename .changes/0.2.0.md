## 0.2.0 - 2022-12-14

### Features

* Heavy refactor of the application to better reflect how its use has evolved as well as to be more performant.
* Removed the redundant "Commit Hash" from the version command
* Default "config" command will now list local site values as well as global app configuration values
* The default PHP version for new installs is now 8.1
* Assign a random port to bind the database to the host. This allows external DB apps like TablePlus to be able to access the DB directly
* Add phpMyAdmin to local sites using the `phpmyadmin` setting or start flag
* Add initial Linux support
* Linux version can now be installed via Homebrew and .deb and .rpm files are available on GitHub releases
* Only install default plugins that aren't already installed
* Warn the user (without failing) if a default plugin cannot be installed

### Bug Fixes

* Using the "name" flag now works with sites that had originally been started with the "--local" flag

### Chores

* Update Go dependencies
