## 0.22.0 - 2024-06-27

### Breaking Changes

* Renamed the `mariadb` config option to `databaseVersion` to better accomodate different database options.
* The `ImageUpdateDays` settings has been renamed to `UpdateInterval`. This will allow it to be reused more easily, where appropriate.

### Features

* Add the ability to use SQLite as a database in place of MariaDB
* Add option to use MySQL in addition to MariaDB and SQLite
* Kana will now check that the database is ready before continuing site setup. This should result in more reliable site startup.

### Bug Fixes

* When outputting JSON results, the extra line break at the end of the output should be removed
* When saving changes to various settings the type of the setting will now be maintained in the config file.

### Chores

* Update project dependencies.
* Improve testing throughout the project
* The `settings` package has been heavily refactored to help ensure stable development in the future.
* Update GitHub Actions for more reliable releases and testing
