## 0.25.0 - 2025-06-28

### Features

* Updates the table output of the `list` command, replacing "Running" with "Status" and color coding the output for easier reading. Does not effect the json output which still uses "running" with a true/false output.

### Bug Fixes

* Don't create a site if the empty-directory warning isn't confirmed.

### Chores

* Update project dependencies.
