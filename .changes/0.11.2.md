## 0.11.2 - 2023-09-04

### Features

* Use the current Docker context to find the correct Docker host. This results in more reliable connections to Docker, particularly with Docker Desktop.
* Kana will no longer try to start Docker automatically if it cannot connect to it on Mac.

### Bug Fixes

* Removed the extra information that reiterated the empty site list on the `list` command as the table format has since made it redundant.
* Upate confirmation text on `stop` command to make it easier to read.

### Chores

* Update project dependencies
